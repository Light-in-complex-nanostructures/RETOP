# RETOP

**RETOP** is an free Matlab toobox that implements a near-to-far-field transformation for computing the radiation diagram. This transformation is implemented in many electromagnetic software, however for most of them, like COMSOL multiphysics, the transformation is restricted to object surrounded by uniform media (free space). **RETOP** operates for objects on substrates or buried in stratified media. It can be used to compute the radiation diagram in the superstrate and the substrate . The substrate may support guided modes or surface plasmon modes with metal layers. **RETOP** additionally computes the in-plane radiation diagram in the guided modes. It just needs the near-field (computed on a rectangular box that contains the object with any full-wave Maxwellâ€™s solver) to compute the radiation diagrams. It is especially relevant for calculating the scattering of nanoparticle on substrates. Special attention is made to the interface with COMSOL Multiphysics.
